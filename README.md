This project is aimed at creating a makefile to build system which would support compilation on three different platforms namely, Beaglebone Black, Freedom Freescale and host machine. The project aimed at creating a makefile that would be architecture independent i.e. the main aim was to generate a flow of commands that would generate files and commands depending on the platform selected.
The make file plays an important role in automating the build process. The make file offers the facility of updating the outputs only if the source file is changed. With a set of directives in the makefile, we can control how a system is build. Makefile helps in improving the overall capability of a system. They breakdown system in different parts which need not be everytime used for compilation. So, this helps in reducing the overall efficiency.
